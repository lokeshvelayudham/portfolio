## JavaScript in My Projects

I have extensively used JavaScript in my full-stack development projects, primarily in web applications utilizing the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**. Key applications include:

- **Frontend**: Built dynamic user interfaces using React, ensuring responsive and interactive user experiences.
- **Backend**: Developed server-side logic using Node.js and Express, handling APIs, user authentication, and data processing.
- **Middleware**: Implemented JWT for secure authentication and authorization across the application.
- **Microservices**: Integrated various services for real-time search and communication within the app.

By leveraging JavaScriptâ€™s versatility, I created scalable, robust applications that enhance user engagement and performance.
