## Node.js in My Projects

I have extensively used Node.js for building scalable back-end services and real-time applications. Some of the key projects include:

- **Event Management Application**: In an event management platform, I developed the back-end using Node.js and Express. This handled operations such as student and judge registrations, matching algorithms, and score computation for research events.

- **API Development**: Used Node.js to create RESTful APIs for user authentication, database interactions, and handling requests efficiently in multiple projects.

- **Real-Time Applications**: Leveraged Node.jsâ€™s asynchronous capabilities to build real-time chat features and live event updates, enabling smooth and instantaneous communication within the application.

- **Integration with Front-End**: Node.js was used in conjunction with React to create a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.

Node.js has been central to my development process for creating robust, scalable back-end systems and efficient handling of I/O operations.
