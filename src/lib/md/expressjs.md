## Express.js in My Projects
Express.js has been an integral part of many of my full-stack and back-end projects. Some notable use cases include:

### Alter Cabs
### gitCraft
### guvi
### intersection

- **Event Management Application**: In my event registration and judging platform, I utilized Express.js to handle the server-side logic, including user authentication, registration workflows, and matching algorithms between students and judges.

- **REST API Development**: I created RESTful APIs using Express.js for handling data requests, CRUD operations, and secure communication between the front-end and the database.

- **Middleware Implementation**: I integrated middleware in Express.js for JWT-based authentication, file uploads, error handling, and request validation, ensuring smooth and secure operations.

- **Routing for Multiple Modules**: Used Express.js to define and manage routes for different user roles (students, judges, and admins) in an event management system, providing clean and modular routing.

Express.js, with its simplicity and flexibility, allowed me to build scalable, efficient, and organized back-end systems while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
