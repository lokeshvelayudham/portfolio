## TypeScript in My Projects

In my development work, Iâ€™ve utilized TypeScript for both frontend and backend projects to ensure more reliable and maintainable code. Key applications include:

- **Frontend Development**: Used TypeScript with Angular for building scalable, interactive web applications. The strict typing system helped catch errors at compile time and enforced consistency across components.
  
- **Backend Development**: Implemented Node.js with TypeScript for server-side logic, ensuring strong type-checking, better error handling, and a more structured codebase.

- **Full-Stack Development**: By using TypeScript across both the frontend and backend, I maintained a consistent code structure, enhancing communication between API services and the client-side.

The use of TypeScript allowed me to build scalable, maintainable, and robust applications with fewer runtime errors and better overall code quality.
