## MongoDB in My Projects

I have utilized MongoDB extensively in my full-stack applications, particularly when working with complex and evolving data structures. Some of the key applications include:

- **Event Registration and Judging System**: In the student-judge matching application, MongoDB was used to store and manage student and judge profiles, event registrations, and judging criteria. Its flexible schema allowed for dynamic updates as requirements evolved during development.

- **B2B Food Supply Chain Application (Foox Technologies)**: MongoDB was the primary database used to store order data, product inventories, client information, and transaction histories. Its ability to handle large datasets and its flexibility in modeling different data types made it an ideal choice for this application.

- **Scalable API Development**: MongoDB’s performance and scalability features allowed me to build efficient APIs for handling thousands of user requests and interactions per second, ensuring smooth operations even under heavy loads.

- **Real-Time Data Handling**: MongoDB’s horizontal scalability and sharding capabilities allowed me to handle real-time data processing and event tracking effectively, ensuring fast response times and low latency.

MongoDB's flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with Node.js made it a go-to choice for building high-performance, data-driven applications in my​⬤
