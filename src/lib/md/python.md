## Python in My Projects

In my development work, I’ve utilized Python in various capacities, particularly in:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python’s robust data science ecosystem, including Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

- **Web Development**: Used Flask to create web applications, focusing on rapid development and scalability, integrating RESTful APIs for smooth interaction between frontend and backend systems.

- **Automation Scripts**: Developed Python scripts to automate file handling, data extraction, and reporting tasks, significantly reducing manual workload and improving efficiency.

- **Data Analysis**: Leveraged Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, creating insightful reports with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Python’s adaptability allowed me to work on diverse projects across various domains, making it my primary language for development and problem-solving.
