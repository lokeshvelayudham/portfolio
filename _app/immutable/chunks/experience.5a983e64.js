• Automated student-judge matching for 1500+ students and 250+ judges, improving event efficiency.

• Collaborated with University IT to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) for secure user access.


 


• Previously, matching students with judges was done manually, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially during the event. As participant numbers grew, ensuring accurate matches became challenging. To address this, we built an application to automate the entire process from registration to student-judge matching and score evaluation. This solution reduces time, enhances accuracy, and streamlines communication for more efficient event management.

The Intersection application has three primary modules:

1. Student Registration: Allows students to register, provide details, upload poster presentations, and track registration status.

2. Judge Registration: Enables judges (post-docs, master's students, PhD candidates, and staff) to create profiles, specify expertise, and indicate availability for suitable matching.

3. Admin Operations: Manages student-judge matching, mailing, and score evaluation. Uses an algorithm to match students with judges based on criteria. Supports bulk mailing to judges about assignments and updates. Automates score evaluation by computing and averaging judges' scores for efficient competition outcomes.`,contract:o.PartTime,type:"Software Development",location:"Cleveland, OH",period:{from:new Date(2024,0,1)},skills:n("ts","js","reactjs","nodejs","expressjs","mysql"),name:"Software Developer - Undergraduate Research Office",color:"red",links:[],logo:e.CWRU,shortDescription:"Products and tools for Case Western Reserve University - undergraduate research office"},{slug:"software-alter-cabs",company:"Alter Cabs",description:`Alter Cabs: Founded in 2024, Alter Cabs aims to provide a premium, reliable, and transparent ride-hailing experience for discerning customers, with a strong focus on safety, cleanliness, and professional service.
